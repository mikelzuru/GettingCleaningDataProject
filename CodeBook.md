==========================

This is a file which describes the transformations of data from the original set and
gives information relative to the generated tidy dataSet.

This new data set has 40 observations and 68 variables. "idSubject" has the same meaning as in the original
dataset, the id-s in "subject_train.txt" or "subject_test.txt" which identifies who performed the activity for each window sample.
"ActivityName" represent the values contained in "y_train.txt" and "y_test.txt" after having them switched by "activity_labels.txt"
in the original dataset in order to have descriptive activity names.

Variables from 3 to 68 need no much clarification. The most important thing is that running "run_analysis.R"
script, both "train" and "test" datasets are merged, so this 66 variables contain the mean of all cases
in the original data set related to the variables with the same name.

Variables in tidy dataSet:
